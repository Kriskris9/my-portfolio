# OfficialResume

## Description 

This is my official resume. It is a single page application that uses three.js to make it very animated. It contains my contact information, previous projects, and demonstrates my new skills as a software developer 

## Usage

You may chose to use the mouse to scroll down or press the down key on the keypad. 

## Credits 

I would like to thank Fireship, on Youtube, for teaching me how to create a 3D portfolio with vite.
